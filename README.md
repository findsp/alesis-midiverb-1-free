## About This Library

Before we start: this library of **59 true stereo impulse responses** is **completely free**. You can pay any amount you like, but anything above $0 is purely optional and very much appreciated.

The **Alesis MIDIVERB** is a budget-friendly digital reverb unit released in **1986**. It’s a preset-only machine, but it contains some genuinely characterful, grainy reverbs. Several of the smaller room presets work especially well when used subtly, adding a sense of *air* and depth without overwhelming a mix.

## What’s Included

This library contains **59 true stereo IRs**, one corresponding to each preset on the original hardware\*.  
Each IR consists of **two WAV files** (left and right channels).

### Compatibility Notes

- Some convolution plugins (for example, **Kilohearts Convolver**) may not support this true stereo format.
- These IRs work correctly with **Ableton Live’s convolution reverb devices** and other convolution engines that support true stereo operation.
